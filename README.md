## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/anywaifu/auto-resume.git
    cd auto-resume
    ```
2.  **Launch with Docker:**
    (Requires Docker and Docker Compose)
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

3.  **Access ResumeLM:**
    Open your web browser to: `http://localhost:8010`

4.  **Initial Configuration:**
    *   Navigate to the **Config** page.
    *   Enter your **OpenAI API Key** in the "LLM Settings" section. This is required for PDF import parsing and ATS optimization.
    *   Select your preferred OpenAI model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).
    *   Save the settings.

## üíª Workflow (Import -> Configure -> Select -> Optimize & Download)

Follow these steps for efficient resume tailoring:

1.  **Import Resume:**
    *   Go to the **Config** page.
    *   Use the "Import Resume" section to upload your base resume PDF. Assign it a name.
    *   *(Tip: You can use the sample resume PDF located in the `sample/` folder if you don't have one handy).*
    *   The resume will appear in the "My Resumes" list on the right.
2.  **(Optional) Configure Optimization Settings:**
    *   **Provide Job Context:** While still on the **Config** page, paste the target **Job Description** into the "ATS Optimization" section and save. This helps the AI tailor the resume more specifically. *Optimization can also run without a job description set.*
    *   **Adjust AI Instructions:** Review the "Custom ATS Prompt" on the Config page. Modify it if you want to change how the AI optimizes. *Note: The prompt should instruct the AI to generate HTML styled with pure inline CSS, as this ensures proper rendering in the exported PDF.* Save any changes. *The default prompt includes this instruction.*
3.  **Select & Review:**
    *   Now, in the "My Resumes" list on the Config page, click "Select" next to your resume. This takes you to the editor page.
    *   Review the parsed content across the different tabs (Basic Info, Work, Skills, etc.). Make any necessary edits; changes are saved automatically.
4.  **Optimize & Download:**
    *   Click the **"ATS Optimize"** button on the editor page.
    *   Wait for the AI to process and update the preview panel.
    *   Review the AI-enhanced resume content.
    *   Click the **"Download Optimized"** button (which becomes active after optimization) to get the tailored PDF.
