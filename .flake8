# These are common directories that usually don't need checking.
# flake8 excludes some of these by default, but being explicit is good practice.

# Optional: Set max line length (default is 79, PEP 8 recommendation)
# max-line-length = 88 # Black formatter default
max-line-length = 115

# Optional: Ignore specific error/warning codes globally
# Example: ignore = E203, W503
# E203: whitespace before ':' (often conflicts with Black formatter)
# W503: line break before binary operator (PEP 8 changed preference)
# ignore = E203, W503
